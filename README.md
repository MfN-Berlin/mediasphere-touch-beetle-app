# Responsive Touch Beetle

The starting point for the tactile model is a 3D scan of a dor beetle from the museum's collection. The 3D data had to be prepared by our project managers for reproduction as a model. Thanks to high-resolution photographs of the beetle, even the most delicate body parts could be matched with the digital twin to recreate the dor beetle as lifelike as possible.
